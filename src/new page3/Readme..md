Page 3.: Tuning the Optimizer

Current Updates : Tuning the optimzer for learning rate. Each optimizer has a different optimum learning rate.
This visualization attempts to depict the training loss curves for all 3 optimizers for each learning rate on a hover. The learning rates can be clicked to compare loss curves for optimizers across different learning rates.
Pending work : Legend for optimizers (--, .., __ ), Label for learning rates, check color palette for color blindness compatibilty.

Other planned work for this page : Add 1 interactive visualization to show convergence speeds of all different optimizers on a single plot, add text description. 

The planned layout for page 3 is as follows:
